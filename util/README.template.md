A simple Go program that displays throughput stats for network interfaces.

## Quickstart

Assuming you have your Go environment and path set up in a
[standard way](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies),
this should get you started.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/robkingsbury/bndstat
$ cd bndstat/util
$ ./install.sh
$ bndstat
$ bndstat --help
```

## Usage

HELPOUTPUT

### Examples

In this example, running on a raspberry pi that I am using as a router, eth0 is the hardline connection to wifi router, eth1 is my
primary internet provider, eth2 is my backup internet line and wlan0 is a connection to the wifi network:

Another example on the same machine, illustrating the device filter and using options instead of args for the interval and
count parameters:

### Debug Logging
If you want to see the innerworkings of `bndstat`, you can use options from the standard Go [glog package](https://github.com/golang/glog). For example:

## Throughput Package

Device stats are available programmatically via the *throughput* package. See http://godoc.org/github.com/robkingsbury/bndstat/throughput for the GoDoc package documentation.

## Supported Platforms

As of v0.4.0, only Linux is supported. The Linux library relies on information from `/proc/net/dev` so it *should* work on most Linux systems. Very long device names would probably make the output look a little wonky since the column width is static right now.
