A simple Go program that displays throughput stats of each network interface.

## Quickstart

```
$ git clone https://github.com/robkingsbury/bndstat
$ cd bndstat
$ go build
$ ./bndstat
$ ./bndstat --help
```

## Usage

```
$ bndstat --help
Usage: bndstat [option]... [interval [count]]
Output the average throughput of network devices over a time interval.

Interval and count have the same behavior as the options of the same
name. However, when both an option and the non-option arg are present,
the value specified by the option takes precedence.

Interval is specified as a float for both the option and arg.

Options [default]:
  --interval=seconds    Number of seconds between updates [1.0]
  --count=num           Number of updates to print, any num less than one
                          will output infinite updates [0]
  --devices=list        Comma separated list of devices to output; if empty,
                          all non-loopback devices are included [empty]
  --unit=string         Specify the output unit; is one of bps, kbps, mbps
                          or tbps; input is not case sensitive [kbps]
  --helpfull            List all available options [false]
```

### Debug Logging
If you want to see the innerworkings for `bndstat` while it's running, use these options from the glog package:

 `bndstat --logtostderr --v=2`
